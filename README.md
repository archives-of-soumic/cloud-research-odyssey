Hello there, wonderful person! So recently I found a course on backend stuff. I look forward to keeping all the study materials in this repository (maybe I'll need to create some more repos 
depending on the course, but for now, this repo is the default location).

I'm no expert of software documentation, sorry if I'm doing it wrong. But I think it's probably a good idea to organize things in different folders/files.

## Pre-requisites:
1. Linux
2. Terminal
